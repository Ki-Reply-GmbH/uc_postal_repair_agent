and repairing errors in code files. It uses a language model to generate tasks 
based on a failed log, find the file with the error, repair the file, and

class RepairAgent:
    """
    A class used to repair source code files. A CI/CD log is provided to the 
    RepairAgent, which indicates a failing workflow run. Based on this 
    information, the Agent generates tasks, finds the file with the error, and
    corrects the error. It then generates a commit message to be used in a pull
    request. 

    Attributes
    ----------
    _prompts : PromptConfig
        an instance of PromptConfig that contains the prompts for the language 
        model
    _model : LLModel
        an instance of LLModel that is the language model used for generating 
        tasks and responses
    _failed_log : str
        a string that represents a failing GitHub Actions workflow run
    _tasks : dict
        a dictionary that contains the tasks generated by the language model
    _response : str
        a string that contains the response from the language model

    -------
    get_f_name():
        Returns the file name from the tasks.
    get_explanation():
        Returns the explanation from the tasks.
    get_error_area():
        Returns the error area from the tasks.
    get_response():
        Returns the response from the language model.
    _make_tasks():
        Generates tasks using the language model and the log prompt.
    find_file(path: str, file_name: str, file_content: str):
        Finds and returns the path of a file with a specific name and content.
    repair_file(file_path: str):
        Repairs a file at a specific path using the language model.
